## Snake

Play the classic game snake where you control a small that snake and as you eat food you get larger. Watch out though, if you run into yourself or hit a wall, it's game over!

**Installation**

To run snake, you will need the [Guizero](https://github.com/lawsie/guizero) library, [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml) library, Python [CSV](https://pypi.org/project/python-csv/) library, and the Python [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library.
